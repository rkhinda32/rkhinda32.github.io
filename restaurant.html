  <p>Recipes for breakfast</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Simple Cheese Omlette: 2 large free-range eggs, olive oil, 10g cheddar cheese. 
     First, crack the eggs into a mixing bowl, season with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then beat well with a spoon until fully combined. Second, place a small non-stick frying pan on low heat to warm up. Third, grate the cheese onto a board and set aside. Fourth, add 1/2 tablespoon of oil to the frying pan when it is hot, then carefully pour in the eggs. Fifth, tilt the pan to spread the eggs evenly. using a spoon to swirl the eggs to the pan. Sixth, when the omlette begins to cook, but still has raw egg on top, sprinkle some cheese. Seventh, using a spatula, ease around the edges of the omlette, then fold it over in half. And last but not least, when it starts to turn golden brown underneath, remove the pan from the heat and slide the omlette onto a plate. Delicious with some tomatoe salad. </li>
